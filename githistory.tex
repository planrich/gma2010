\section {A brief history of Git}

The Linux kernel development was originally handled by a patch-emailing system, but in 2002 Linus Torvalds and his development team moved to the Source Code Management (SCM) system BitKeeper.
In 2005, BitMover (developer of BitKeeper) stopped their support for open-source projects. That's why soon after Linus was desperately trying to find a new system to handle the Linux kernel development, without success. They were either slow or simply not distributed. So Linus simply decided that he is able to write his own SCM - Git - which he already released in April 2005.

Git became a huge success. Originally used for nothing but the Linux kernel, soon other projects chose Git to handle the development. A few popular examples are X.org, Fedora, Samba and Ruby on Rails. \cite{gitinternals2008}
