\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

It can be seen that Distributed Version Control Systems offer a whole bunch of new possibilites for many people to work distributed on one project. Compared to the models of the Centralized Version Control Systems, distributed ones simplify the workflows for every project member, making it possible to work locally and provide or get the work of others as he decides to - or not. Apart from that, Branching in DVCS is a simple yet effective way to implement new features into the project. Effective merging algorithms make it possible for multiple people to work on the same file without having to worry about content loss. \newline
By choosing a modern DVCS like Git, users get a fast and easy-to-learn DVCS which should fulfill all their needs. Community projects like Github connect these users to a large community. Newcomers can not only start their own projects, they can easyiely join an existing project. All these features are making it easy to get started into the DVCS world.
