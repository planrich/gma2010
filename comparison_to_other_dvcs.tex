\section {Comparison to other DVCS}

There are several more distributed version control systems
we are going to explain some differences to git.
Some are:

  \begin{enumerate}
     \item \emph{Bazaar}. Powered by Cannocial. Handles the whole Ubuntu source
     repository at launchpad.net
     \item \emph{Mercurial} An opensource project initiated by Matt Mackall
     \item \emph{Perforce}. Powered by Perforce Software Inc.
     \item \emph{Visual SourceSafe} Powered by Microsoft
  \end{enumerate}
  
We are going to take a closer look at \emph{Baazar} and \emph{Mercurial}
compared to Git.

\subsection {Data storage}

As already mentioned git uses it's unique storage model creating new snapshots
every commit. Mercurial also thinks of its data as a snapshot. The difference
is though, that basically Mercurial also creates deltas from a revsion A to B.
Those deltas are infact the difference between two revsions. When a cumulative
amount of deltas is stored to a file, Mercurial creates a new snapshot of this file.

Baazar TODO!!

\subsection {Speed}

Git claims to be a very efficient system. To mesure that there are several
methods. The website \emph{whygitisbetterthanx.com} did a quite good job to
summarize why git does handle things quite fast.

\subsection {Size}
